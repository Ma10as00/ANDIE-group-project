/**
 * <p>
 * This interface describes a class that records what operations are applied to
 * an image, and stores them in an ordered list.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The recorder only cares about the operations that changes the image
 * {@link ImageOperation}, and not what actions the user performs in the GUI
 * {@link ImageAction}. E.g. if an UndoAction is made, this will not be detected, because no
 * {@link ImageOperation}s are applied to the image.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * When the image changes, the recorder should realize this, and add the
 * operation that was done to the list.
 * In particular, the recorder should react every time
 * {@link EditableImage#apply(ImageOperation)} is called. (Or every time the
 * field {@code ops} is changed.)
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * For implementations of this interface to be able to track the
 * ImageOperations, they need to be added in the ImagePanel ({@code target}),
 * with the following line of code:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * {@code target.addPropertyChangeListener("image", new OperationRecorder(target));}
 * The propertyChange() method will then be triggered every time the image
 * changes.
 * This method should retrieve the last {@link ImageOperation} that was applied
 * to the image, and add it to the list of recorded operations.
 * </p>
