# ANDIE, Return 'A+';

## Team Members

The team behind this ANDIE, Return 'A+';, consists of Michael Campbell, James Liu, Mathias Øgaard, Stella Srzich and Katie Wink. We met every week on Fridays to set goals for the week and reflect on our progress, and on Tuesdays to complete lab tasks and touch base. The team worked in a democratic style, where all team members had a say in the features of ANDIE and who should be responsible for each task. However, the team was somewhat led by Stella, who kept track of progress and had a big-picture view of the project. 

Each team member had the following responsibilities:
- Michael: Multilingual support, image resize, keyboard shortcuts, and toolbar
- James: Brightness/contrast adjustment, drawing functions, testing log, and licencing
- Mathias: Image rotations and flips, JUnit tests, and macros for recording and replaying operations
- Stella: Filters, JUnit tests, README, debugging, error avoidance/prevention, and change mode
- Katie: Image export, mouse selection, crop, drawing functions, and change mode

Note, however, all team members helped others with their responsibilities from time to time. And, we were all responsible for testing the project through interaction with the GUI, exception handling, and correct use of documentation within our classes.


## Testing

We tested ANDIE by inserting print statements, interacting with the GUI, running JUnit tests with continuous integration, and keeping a testing log. In the beginning, when we started to implement our features, we each focused on making sure our features worked for expected inputs. So, we only interacted with the GUI, acting as a perfect user, meaning we had a baseline to improve on. We also entered statements within methods to print to the command line to make sure values, such as floats in a kernel, widths and heights of an image, or values returned by methods, were matching what we expected. These print statements helped us validate that the expected behaviour was (or was not) occurring, even when we could not check it with our bare eyes. On top of this, Stella and Mathias developed JUnit tests to confirm that the correct behaviour persisted. This meant that every time we pushed we could immediately see if something had gone awry.

Then, once all features were implemented, James tested how they interacted together. He thoroughly applied many combinations of different actions after each push was made, and then texted on the group chat to let us know if anything unexpected occurred. Then, whoever was responsible for the feature could go in and fix it. The result of this testing can be seen under the 'tests' folder in 'testing_log.txt'. This text file keeps track of what bugs were fixed, what bugs could be fixed, and the current behaviour of ANDIE. Concurrently, once features worked in the perfect case, all team members tested by interacting with the GUI, acting as normal, fallible users. Then, we noted down any issues, including ones that crashed the program, such as opening non-image files or entering non-ints for the radius of a filter, and ones that could cause problems for the user, such as allowing them to exit without reminding them to save changes or apply a resize with no image open.

Once we thought all bugs had been dealt with, and that the program ran perfectly, we got our friends, who aren't computer science majors, to test ANDIE. They provided feedback on the user experience and revealed bugs we had never noticed before. 


## User Guide

### Description
‘ANDIE’ stands for A Non-Destructive Image Editor. The purpose of the program is to edit and manipulate images – like Photoshop but much, much simpler. The approach taken in ANDIE is non-destructive image editing. Many image processing operations, such as blurring filters, once applied to an image, cannot be reversed because information is lost in the process. Non-destructive image editors take the approach of storing the original image and the sequence of operations applied. Then, the operations can be applied to the original image to get the desired result. But since the original image and the full sequence of operations have been kept separately, no information is lost. 

ANDIE supports English, Māori, Norwegian, German and Spanish, which you can select under the '**Language**' menu. ANDIE is also available in dark mode and light mode, whatever your preference, which you can select under the '**View**' menu. And, for your convenience, commonly used actions have keyboard shortcuts, as indicated in their respective menus.

### Opening and Saving Images
ANDIE supports editing images with image file formats of PNG. Images are stored as image files, as you would expect. And, operations, which are the operations you may have applied to edit a particular image, are stored as operations files of the format png.ops.

You can use '**Open**', under the '**File**' menu to open an image file, possibly with operations applied as well. Note, this may not open an image how you would expect in a typical image editor.

- '**Open**' will open the selected image file, and will automatically open an associated operations file if it exists in the same directory. An operations file is associated with an image file if it has the same name as the image file with a '.ops' at the end. So, for example, if you open an image file called 'cat.png', and there is an operations file called 'cat.png.ops' in the same directory, both the image file and operations file will be opened. This means that if you previously edited the image 'cat.png' and clicked '**Save**' when you open the image 'cat.png' again, the operations you applied will automatically be reapplied and you will see the edited image. If there is no associated operations file, however, ANDIE will just open the image file, and you will see the unedited image.

Then, once you have applied operations to edit the image and are happy with the result, you can choose to save it by using '**Save**', '**Save As**' or '**Export**', under the '**File**' menu. Note that each of these is quite different, and may not behave how you would expect in a typical image editor. To clarify this, however, the header indicates the image file currently open and whether or not the image operations currently applied are saved in an associated operations file.

- '**Save**' will save the operations file, which holds the operations currently applied to edit the image. This will be automatically called the name of the image file you opened with a '.ops' appended at the end. It will not do anything to the image file you opened. So, for example, if you open an image file called 'cat.png', apply some operations to edit the image, and then click '**Save**', ANDIE will save the operations in an operations file called 'cat.png.ops'. This means that the next time you open the image in ANDIE, you will see the edited image, but, the image file will remain unchanged.

- '**Save As**' will do the same thing as '**Save**', however, it will allow you to choose the name of the image and operations files. This means that a new image file identical to the original image file and the operations applied to the image will be saved under the given name. So, for example, if you open an image file called 'cat.png', apply some operations to edit the image, and then click '**Save As**', and enter the file name 'grey_cat.png', ANDIE will save the operations in an operations file called 'grey_cat.png.ops', and will save an image file identical to 'cat.png' called 'grey_cat.png'. Note, however, this means that any further operations will be acting on 'grey_cat.png'. And, if you open the image 'cat.png' in ANDIE, the image will not appear edited according to the operations saved as, as it is not associated with the operations file 'grey_cat.png.ops'.

- '**Export**' will allow you to export your edited image as a new image file, with the operations applied. So, for example, if you open an image file called 'cat.png', apply some operations to edit the image, and then click '**Export**', and enter the file name 'grey_cat.png', ANDIE will save the new, edited image in an image file called 'grey_cat.png'. This means you will have a new image file of the edited image. Note, however, any further operations to edit the image will still be acting on 'cat.png', as that is the image file you have open.

### Editing Images
To edit an image, ANDIE allows you to apply, and record, operations to filter the image, draw on the image, and change the orientation, size and colour of the image. These operations appear under the menus '**Orientation**', '**Resize**', '**Colour**', '**Filter**', '**Tools**' and '**Macro**'. Common operations also appear in the intuitive toolbar. This includes 'Save', 'Undo', 'Redo', 'Zoom In', 'Zoom Out', 'Zoom Full', 'Rotate Right', 'Rotate Left', 'Crop', 'Select Region' and 'Choose Colour'.  

- The '**Orientation**' menu allows you to rotate and flip your image. You can rotate your image by 90 degrees to the left or right, or by 180 degrees. You can also flip your image along its horizontal or vertical axes. 

- The '**Resize**' menu allows you to resize your image.  You can resize your image by 50%, making its width and height half of its original width and height. You can also resize your image by 150%, making its width and height one and a half times its original width and height. You can also choose to do a custom resize, where you can select the percent you would like to resize your image by. Note that these operations will change the width and height of the edited image. This is in contrast to the '**View**' menu, which will not change the width and height of the edited image but will change how you view the edited image on your screen.

- The '**Colour**' menu allows you to change the colour of the whole image. You can convert your image to greyscale, removing the hue from the image. You can also change the contrast and brightness of your image according to the amount you have selected.

- The '**Filter**' menu allows you to apply various filters to your image. You can apply a sharpen filter, which sharpens the image. You can also apply blur filters, which will blur an image according to the radius you have provided. Note, a larger radius creates a stronger blur. Each of the blur filters creates a slightly different blur; The mean filter, which blurs the image by essentially averaging the pixel values, creates a typical blur. The median blur filter creates a blockier blur. And, the Gaussian blur filter creates a more natural blur. You can also apply emboss filters, in many directions, which makes objects in the image appear as if they are 'poking out' or 'poking in' in a given direction. 

    This menu also contains a range of Sobel filters which generally detect edges in the image. The horizontal Sobel filter detects the horizontal edges of the image in greyscale, with grey indicating no edge, white indicating an edge from bright to dark, and black indicating an edge from dark to bright (moving upwards). The vertical Sobel filter works in the same way but detects the vertical edges of the image. The full Sobel filter detects both horizontal and vertical edges in the image, essentially showing you all edges of the image. Contrary to the horizontal and vertical Sobel filters, however, it will show all edges, regardless of orientation, as a bright white and everything else as black. Luminosity indicates the intensity of the edge. Lastly, the orientation Sobel filter works in the same way as the full Sobel filter but conveys the orientation of edges using hue. See **Note** for more information on how this works. Also note, you can 'Remove Noise' when applying Sobel and Emboss filters, which will apply a Gaussian blur filter of radius 1 before applying the typical filter. This effect cannot be seen very well with human eyes but is crucial in many digital imaging applications. 

- The '**Tools**' menu allows you to crop selected regions and draw shapes, both outlined and filled, with selected colours and widths. You can drag your mouse to select a region and then crop it to the selected size. You can also drag your mouse to draw lines, outlined and filled rectangles, and outlined and filled ellipses. The colour of these shapes, and the width of lines and outlines, can be customised before drawing the shape. Note that previewed width of lines is exactly how the lines and outlined shapes will be drawn, regardless of your current zoom level.

- The '**Macro**' menu allows you to record and apply macros. Macros are sequences of operations that you can apply to any image. So, you may start recording, apply your choice of image operations, and then end the recording to save the '.ops' file. Then, you can apply that '.ops' file to any image you open in ANDIE. Note the distinction between '.png.ops' operations files, which are operations associated with a particular image file, and '.ops' files, which are treated as sets of operations you can apply to any image. Also note, ANDIE does not currently support, and will not let you, undo or redo image operations while recording macros.

If you would like to undo or redo an operation or undo all operations you have applied to your image, you can do so under the '**Edit**' menu. Note, however, you can only undo and redo operations that you have applied since you opened an image file, or that have been saved in an operations file associated with the image file.


## Note

We have implemented many subtle improvements of features beyond the specification of ANDIE. This includes but is not limited to, the frame header indicating the name of a file and whether it is saved, an option to change to light or dark mode, a macro menu colour change to indicate when a macro is recording, a full Sobel filter, a variable sharpen filter, a custom zoom option, an undo all option, and the option to remove noise before applying emboss and Sobel filters. However, in particular, our 'show us something' is the orientation Sobel filter. This works by imagining each pixel as a 'vector' centred at the origin in the Cartesian plane, with its x value given by the pixel's value after applying a horizontal Sobel filter and its y value given by the pixel's value after applying a vertical Sobel filter. Then, the luminosity of the pixel in the output is determined by the norm of this vector. This matches the luminosities in the full Sobel filter. And, if you imagine a colour space with the arbitrary decision to make the positive x-axis red, the negative x-axis green, the positive y-axis yellow and the negative y-axis blue, the hue is determined by where this 'vector' is orientated in this plane. This reflects the actual orientation of edges in the image.

Also note, we have extremely changed the structure of many of ANDIE's classes to suit our needs. However, the code should still build and run akin to the skeleton code that was provided.
