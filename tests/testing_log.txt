Current Behaviour of ANDIE:
File Menu
	· If you click Open with no image open, you will be able to select and open only a PNG file that has a valid name. That is, it doesn't contain more than one '.', and the name before '.png' is not null. Then, the name displayed in the title of ANDIE will change to "ANDIE (filename.png)" and the frame will be packed around the opened image. If you click Open with an image open, a warning box will warn you that any unsaved changes will be lost. 
	· If you click Save with no image open, an error box will tell you that there is no image open to save. If you click Save with an image open, if there is an associated operations file in the same directory, the operations currently applied to the image will be saved to that file. If there is no associated operations file in the same directory, a new operations file will be created and the operations applied to the image will be saved to that file (even if there have been no image operations applied).
	· If you click Save As with no image open, an error box will tell you that there is no image open to save as. If you click Save As with an image open, you will be able to select the location and the file name to save as. If the user enters an invalid PNG file name, a warning box will warn them that it is an invalid PNG file name, and the image will not be saved as. If the user enters a file name of an image that already exists in the directory, then a warning box will warn the user and they can decide whether to write over it or not. Note that if there is only an associated operations file with that image file name, it will be overwritten with no warning. This is by design as an operations file should always have an associated image unless the user meddles with the files outside of ANDIE. Then, a new copy of the original image is saved under the new file name and an associated operations file is saved. Then, the image the user currently has open will change to the image that was saved as and the title of ANDIE will change to "ANDIE (filename.png)".
	· If you click Export with no image open, an error box will tell you that there is no image open to export. If you click Export with an image open, you will be able to select the location and the file name to export to. If the user enters an invalid PNG file name, a warning box will warn them that it is an invalid PNG file name, and the image will not be exported. If the user enters a file name of an image that already exists in the directory, then a warning box will warn the user and they can decide whether to write over it or not. Then, a new copy of the edited image will be exported under the file name in the selected location. Note that the image open and thus being edited will stay as the original file open, as indicated by the application title "ANDIE (filename.png)".
	· If you click Exit or close with no image open, the application will close. If you click Exit or close with an image open, a warning box will warn the user that any unsaved changes will be lost and they can decide whether to exit or not.

Edit Menu
	· If the user clicks Undo with no image open, an error box will tell the user that there is no image open to undo operations on. If the user clicks Undo with an image open, but there are no operations to undo, an error box will tell the user that there are no operations to undo. If the user clicks Undo with an image open and operations to undo, the last operation will be undone. This does not include changing the zoom. If this was a resize or rotation operation, the zoom will be reset to 100% and the frame will be packed around the new size of the image. This is to make it clear that resize and rotation changes the size of the actual image, and so that when Zoom Full is clicked, it fits the size of the packed frame.
	· If the user clicks Redo with no image open, an error box will tell the user that there is no image open to redo operations on. If the user clicks Redo with an image open, but there are no operations to redo, an error box will tell the user that there are no operations to redo. If the user clicks Redo with an image open and operations to redo, the last operation will be redone. This does not include changing the zoom. If this was a resize or rotation operation, the zoom will be reset to 100% and the frame will be packed around the new size of the image. This is to make it clear that resize and rotation changes the size of the actual image, and so that when Zoom Full is clicked, it fits the size of the packed frame.
	· If the user clicks Undo all with no image open, an error box will tell the user that there is no image open to undo all operations on. If the user clicks Undo All with an image open, but there are no operations to undo all, an error box will tell the user that there are no operations to undo all. If the user clicks Undo All with an image open all operations will be undone. This does not include changing the zoom. If this was a resize or rotation operation, the zoom will be reset to 100% and the frame will be packed around the new size of the image. This is to make it clear that resize and rotation changes the size of the actual image, and so that when Zoom Full is clicked, it fits the size of the packed frame.

View Menu
	· If the user clicks Zoom In with no image open, an error box will tell the user that there is no image open to zoom on. If the user clicks Zoom In with an image open, the image will be zoomed in by 10%. The frame will not be packed. 
	· If the user clicks Zoom Out with no image open, an error box will tell the user that there is no image open to zoom on. If the user clicks Zoom Out with an image open, the image will be zoomed out by 10%. The frame will not be packed.
	· If the user clicks Zoom Full with no image open, an error box will tell the user that there is no image open to zoom on. If the user clicks Zoom Full with an image open, the image will be zoomed back to fit the last packed frame size. That is, the frame size that was last packed, not the size of the frame that the user may have altered it to.
	· If the user clicks Zoom Change with no image open, an error box will tell the user that there is no image open to zoom on. If the user clicks Zoom Change with an image open, a slider box will allow the user to select a zoom from -50% to 200%. Then, the image will be zoomed accordingly. The frame will not be packed.
	· If the user clicks Change Mode with no image open, this will not effect this action as the Change Mode will take place regardless of image.

Orientation Menu
	· If the user clicks Rotate Right with no image open, an error box will tell the user that there is no image open to rotate. If the user clicks Rotate Right with an image open, the image will be rotated to the right. The zoom will be reset and the frame will be repacked to make it clear that the size of the image has changed, and so that Zoom Full will fit the last packed frame size.
	· If the user clicks Rotate Left with no image open, an error box will tell the user that there is no image open to rotate. If the user clicks Rotate Left with an image open, the image will be rotated to the left. The zoom will be reset and the frame will be repacked to make it clear that the size of the image has changed, and so that Zoom Full will fit the last packed frame size.
	· If the user clicks Rotate by 180 Degrees with no image open, an error box will tell the user that there is no image open to rotate. If the user clicks Rotate by 180 Degrees with an image open, the image will be rotated by 180 degrees. Note that the zoom will not be reset, nor will the frame be packed, as this operation doesn’t change the size of the image.
	· If the user clicks Flip Vertically with no image open, an error box will tell the user that there is no image open to flip. If the user clicks Flip Vertically with an image open, the image will be flipped vertically. Note that the zoom will not be reset, nor will the frame be packed, as this operation doesn’t change the size of the image.
	· If the user clicks Flip Horizontally with no image open, an error box will tell the user that there is no image open to flip. If the user clicks Flip Horizontally with an image open, the image will be flipped horizontally. Note that the zoom will not be reset, nor will the frame be packed, as this operation doesn’t change the size of the image.

Resize Menu
	· If the user clicks Resize 50% with no image open, an error box will tell the user that there is no image open to resize. If the user clicks Resize 50% with an image open, the image will be resized to 50%, now with half of the width and height as before, rounded to the nearest pixel. The zoom will be reset and the frame will be repacked to make it clear that the size of the image has changed, and so that Zoom Full will fit the last packed frame size.
	· If the user clicks Resize 150% with no image open, an error box will tell the user that there is no image open to resize. If the user clicks Resize 150% with an image open, the image will be resized to 150%, now with one and a half of the width and height as before, rounded to the nearest pixel. The zoom will be reset and the frame will be repacked to make it clear that the size of the image has changed, and so that Zoom Full will fit the last packed frame size.
	· If the user clicks Custom Resize with no image open, an error box will tell the user that there is no image open to resize. If the user clicks Custom Resize with an image open, a slider box will appear for the user to enter the resize percent from 50% to 200%. If the resize percent is less that 100%, the image will be resized to a smaller size by that percent. If the resize percent was 100%, the image will not change. If the resize percent was greater that 100%, the image will be resize to a bigger size by that percent. This is all, of course, rounded to the nearest pixel. The zoom will be reset and the frame will be repacked to make it clear that the size of the image has changed, and so that Zoom Full will fit the last packed frame size.

Filter Menu
	· If the user clicks Sharpen Filter with no image open, an error box will tell the user that there is no image open to filter. If the user clicks Sharpen Filter with an image open, the image will be sharpened. The user may keep clicking Sharpen Filter to sharpen the image more. Note that since this is a kernel filter, the edge pixels will become transparent as the kernel cannot act on the edge pixels.
	· If the user clicks Mean Filter with no image open, an error box will tell the user that there is no image open to filter. If the user clicks Mean Filter with an image open, a slider box will allow the user to select the radius from 0 to 10. If 0 is selected, the image is not changed. If a radius is selected from 1 to 10, the bigger the number, the stronger the mean blur is applied. Note that since this is a kernel filter, the edge pixels will become transparent as the kernel cannot act on the edge pixels. This is more noticeable for larger radii.
	· If the user clicks Median Filter with no image open, an error box will tell the user that there is no image open to filter. If the user clicks Median Filter with an image open, a slider box will allow the user to select the radius from 0 to 5. This is more restrictive than the kernel filters, as for radii greater than 5, the filter will take over 10 seconds to apply. If 0 is selected, the image is not changed. If a radius is selected from 1 to 5, the bigger the number, the stronger the median blur is applied. Note that since this is not implemented as a convolution, the edge pixels will not become transparent. Instead, we have decided to not change the edge pixels. So, for larger radii, the un-blurred edge pixels may become more obvious.
	· If the user clicks Gaussian Blur Filter with no image open, an error box will tell the user that there is no image open to filter. If the user clicks Gaussian Blur Filter with an image open, a slider box will allow the user to select the radius from 0 to 10. If 0 is selected, the image is not changed. If a radius is selected from 1 to 10, the bigger the number, the stronger the Gaussian blur is applied. Note that since this is a kernel filter, the edge pixels will become transparent as the kernel cannot act on the edge pixels. This is more noticeable for larger radii.
	· If the user clicks Sobel Filter with no image open, an error box will tell the user that there is no image open to filter. If the user clicks Sobel Filter with an image open, a sobel filter type box will appear for the user to select a directon. The sobel filter calculats the gradient of image intensity at each pixel within the image. A remove noise is also an option for the user that removes any random variation of brightness or color information
	· If the user clicks Emboss Filter with no image open, an error box will tell the user that there is no image open to filter. If the user clicks Emboss Filter with an image open, a slider box will allow the user to select the radius from 1 to 8. If 1 is selected, the image is not changed. If a radius is selected from 1 to 8, the bigger the number, the stronger the Emboss filter is applied. Note Emboss filter traces high-contrast edges in the image with darker versions of the color in the image.

Colour Menu
	· If the user clicks Greyscale with no image open, an error box will tell the user that there is no image open to convert to greyscale. If the user clicks Greyscale with an image open, the image will be converted to greyscale.
	· If the user clicks Brightness with no image open, an error box will tell the user that there is no image open to change the brightness of. If the user clicks Brightness with an image open, a slider box will allow the user to select the brightness amount from -10 to 10. If the user selects an integer less than 0, the brightness will decrease accordingly. Note, if the user selects -10, the image will become fully black. If the user selects 0, the image is not changed. If the user selects an integer greater than 0, the brightness will increase accordingly. Note, if the user selects 10, the image will not become fully white. However, the user can apply multiple Brightness operations on top of each other to keep increasing the brightness if they so wish.
	· If the user clicks Contrast with no image open, an error box will tell the user that there is no image open to change the contrast of. If the user clicks Contrast with an image open, a slider box will allow the user to select the contrast amount from -10 to 10. If the user selects an integer less than 0, the contrast will decrease accordingly. Note, if the user selects -10, the image will become fully black. If the user selects 0, the image is not changed. If the user selects an integer greater than 0, the contrast will increase accordingly.

Language Menu
	· The first time ANDIE is ever run, it will open on English. If the user clicks English, and the language is already set to English, nothing will change. If the user clicks English, and the language is not set to English, the language for will change to English. If the user closes ANDIE with the language set to English, the next time ANDIE is opened, it will be in English.
	· If the user clicks Māori, and the language is already set to Māori, nothing will change. If the user clicks Māori, and the language is not set to Māori, the language for will change to Māori. If the user closes ANDIE with the language set to Māori, the next time ANDIE is opened it will be in Māori. While error and warning panes will now be in Māori, the buttons on them, and particularly the file selector pane, will not be in Māori. 
	· If the user clicks Norwegian, and the language is already set to Norwegian, nothing will change. If the user clicks Norwegian, and the language is not set to Norwegian, the language for will change to Norwegian. If the user closes ANDIE with the language set to Norwegian, the next time ANDIE is opened it will be in Norwegian. While error and warning panes will now be in Norwegian, the buttons on them, and particularly the file selector pane, will not be in Norwegian. 
	· If the user clicks Spanish, and the language is already set to Spanish, nothing will change. If the user clicks Spanish, and the language is not set to Spanish, the language for will change to Spanish. If the user closes ANDIE with the language set to Spanish, the next time ANDIE is opened it will be in Spanish. While error and warning panes will now be in Spanish, the buttons on them, and particularly the file selector pane, will not be in Spanish. 

Macro Menu 
	· If user clicks Macro and than clicks on Start Recording with no image open, an error box will tell the user there is no image open to record a macro on
	· If user clicks Macro and than clicks on End Recording with no image open, an error box will tell the user that recording was not initated 
	· If user clicks Macro and than clicks on Apply Macro with no image open, an error box will tell the user there is no image to apply macros to

Tools Menu 
	· If user clicks Tools and than clicks on Select Region with no image open, an error box will tell the user that there is no image open to selecte a region of. If the user clicks on Select Region with an image open, the user can draw a square and select the Crop tool on the toolbar to crop that section of the image out.
	· If user clicks Tools and than clicks on Crop with no image open, an error box will tell the user there is no image to crop. If the user clicks on Crop with an image open, an error box will tell the user that no region of an area has been selected to be cropped.
	· If user clicks Tools and than clicks on Choose Colour with no image open, an error box will tell the user there is no image to draw colour for. If the user clicks on Choose Colour, the user will get a prompt to select the colour they want.
	· If user clicks Tools and than clicks on Choose Width with no image open, an error box will tell the user that there is no image to choose a draw width for. If the user clicks Choose Width with an image open. A slider box will allow the user to select the thickness of the drawing they are goign to perform
	· If user clicks Tools and than clicks on Draw Line with no image open, an error box will tell the usesr that there is image open to draw a line on. If user clicks Draw Line with an iamge open the user can now draw lines.
	· If user clicks Tools and than clicks on Draw Rectangle than clicks on Filled with no image open, an error box will tell the user that there is no image open to a draw a filled rectangle on. If the user clicks Draw Rectange and Filed with an image open, the user can now draw rectanges that filled in
	· If user clicks Tools and than clicks on Draw Rectangle than clicks on Outlined with no image open, an error box will tell the user there is no image open to draw an outlined rectangle on. If the user clicks Draw Rectange and Outlined with an image open, the suer can now draw outlines of rectanges
	· If user clicks Tools and than clicks on Draw Ellipse and than clicks on Filled with no image open, an error box will tell the user there is image open to draw a filled ellipse on. If the user clicks Draw Ellipse and Filled, the user can now draw ellipse that is filled in.
	· If user clicks Tools and than clicks on Draw Ellipse and than clicks on Outlined with no image open, an error box will tell the user there is no iamge open to draw an outlined ellipse on. If the suer clicks Draw Ellipse and Outlined, the user can now draw the outline of ellipse 



Fixed Bugs:
	• When entering non integers into filter radius it makes it go down to nearest it, or string just does 1.
	• Changed median filter max radius to 5 to stop stalling.
	• When exiting sliders in colour and filter actions, if slider is on a number it still applied colour or filter change.
	• Changed all button names to be all capitalised.
	• Move resize to own menu.
	• Move flips and rotations to own menu.
	• Make sure all key shortcuts don't use the same keys.
	• Make zoom slider as zoom change and make sure that if the user leaves the slider on 0, the zoom doesn't change.
	• Fixed zoom full to actually make image return to initial zoom level.
	• Maybe make it so that if an image is bigger, the panel is bigger and automatically fits it on open.
	• Fix image resize slider to resize image properly.
	• Fix that when opening a new image, other image operations are saved.
	• Pop up box with error message if user clicks buttons other than open and export with no image to apply actions to. Also if try to redo or undo with no image operations to undo or redo.
	• Pop up box with warning message if user clicks exit, open, or cross with an image open.
	• Make sure that all exceptions in code are dealt with correctly. So, differentiate between different exceptions thrown and for each case show pop up box saying something went wrong or possibly close frame.
	• Fix issue of not opening images in Windows (was issue in isValidPNG, which assumed / as delimiter, which is only on mac).
	• Name of image currently being worked on displayed in window (change every time for all FileActions by making a method that creates a Path from imagePanel image name, getting file name, and appending to the title, i.e. ANDIE (cat.png)).
	• Don’t allow user to open non image file (not a JPEG, PNG, BMP, WEBMP, GIF).
	• Only allow to save as with a name ending in .png, and have no other dots.
	• Only allow to export with a name ending in .png.
	• Don't allow user to enter '.png' as a file name itself.
	• If user tries to save as or export file with the same name as an existing file in directory, ask if want to override or cancel.
	• For some reason export and save do not save any image files apart from PNG. Seems to be a mismatch between starting as a PNG and saving as JPEG. Fix this by restricting the user to only be able to deal with PNGs.
	• If Spanish was the last language used, the next time the user opens the application, all JOptionPanes are in Spanish. Fix this by changing 'es' to 'sp', so that the libraries don't register it as Spanish and all JOptionPanes are in English. 
	• Some error messages don't show up and program crashes once multilingual support was included. Some message keys had wrong capitalisation.
	• If you resize an image and then apply a filter, and then change the zoom, and then undo the last operation, the frame will repack to the newly zoomed image. We only want undo and redo to repack the frame if the undone or redone operation was a resize.
	• Repack the frame if the operation was a rotation, as this will also change dimensions of the image.
	• Reset the zoom every time we repack so that the zoom full works. 
	• Make it so that rotate by 180 degrees doesn’t pack the frame or rest zoom, as the size of the image will not have changed.
	
Fixed Bugs 2.0:
	• Added amount to sharpen filter so it is variable. 
	• Made sure that if the entered amount/radius/percentage for sharpen, mean, median, gaussian, custom resize, brightness and contrast is the amount that makes no change, no 'filter' (which does nothing anyway) is applied. 
	• Fixed there being text messages in the contrast and brightness classes, so made them have multilingual support. These messages are just there for back up anyway. 
	• Added undo all button. 
	• Added a private constructor to EditableImage construct a new EditableImage with given parameters. 
	• Added copyEditableImage to EditableImage to create a deep copy of an EditableImage. 
	• Added setImage to ImagePanel so that I can change the image in the image panel. 
	• Made the image react to the slider before clicking OK for brightness, contras, mean, sharpen, gauss, median, custom zoom and custom resize. 
	• Fixed that after a resize with the slider the zoom gets reset. We don’t want that. 
	• Made median filter slider less laggy by only updating the image if the slider change is greater than or equal to 1. 
	• Added extended filters for sharpen, mean and gaussian. Applied this to median in a slightly different way. This also fixed issue of many resizes making the edges blurry. 
	• Fixed the crop selection bug so that you can select to the edge of an image but not over it. 
	• Made the emboss filter option pane make more intuitive sense. 
	• Changed the Sobel filters to only be under one header and have a pop up box with the option to press each one. And, have a check box to remove noise or not. 
	• Fixed bug of crop action and draw actions not saving or saving as when applied to an image. 
	• Fixed that the macro would not actually save if you enter the wrong file name and then try to save again. 
	• Made the file chooser keep popping up if the user clicks a non .ops file when applying a macro. 
	• Don't let the user open, save, save as or export when recording a macro. 
	• Fixed capitalisation of macro menu option titles.  
	• Made an error message for when an image is open but a region is not selected when cropping. 
	• Made Sobel JOptionPane only show changes to image when the button is actually clicked, not hovered on. 
	• Made file open, export and save as keep prompting the user for a file until they either successfully open/save/export a file, or cancel. 
	• Made macro not allowed to initiate if an image is not open. 
	• Show that an image operation has been saved/unsaved in frame header. 
	• Only show the warning message when exiting or opening if the image is unsaved. 
	• Make it so that when you open an image, the application stays where it is. 
	• Make the ImagePanel centred in the outer panel. 
	• Made toolbar, outer panel and menu not have borders. 
	• Fixed an issue of the bottom of the tool bar not changing colours with dark mode. 
	• Made the frame not repack when changing the mode. 
	• Fixed custom zoom bug where you could not fully zoom in or out if you start with too high or low of a zoom. 
	• Fixed the width change only applying after you have drawn the image and deselect. 
	• Fixed the colours changing when you undo the last operation. 
	• Made crop and draw actions compatible with the level of zoom.  

Possible Bugs:
	• Get rid of the borders in the colour and file choosers for aesthetic. Also get rid of the focus on the buttons to look more modern.
